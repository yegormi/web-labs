        <h2 class="heading">The Founding of Apple Inc.</h2>
        <p>Apple Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by <span class="bold">Steve Jobs</span>, <span class="italic">Steve Wozniak</span>, and <span class="bold">Ronald Wayne</span> in Cupertino, California. From its humble beginnings in a garage, Apple would go on to transform the world of technology.</p>
        <p>Initially, the company was focused on creating personal computers, with the first product, the <span class="highlight">Apple I</span>, being a simple yet revolutionary piece of hardware. The idea of offering a pre-assembled computer was radical at the time, as most hobbyists were still building machines from scratch.</p>

    <section class="history">
        <h2 class="heading">The Early Days</h2>
        <p>It all started with the <span class="highlight">Apple I</span>, a computer designed and hand-built by Wozniak. Unlike other computers at the time, the Apple I came as a fully assembled circuit board, which was revolutionary in 1976. Steve Jobs convinced Wozniak to sell it, and they managed to sell 200 units, mostly to hobbyists and computer enthusiasts.</p>
